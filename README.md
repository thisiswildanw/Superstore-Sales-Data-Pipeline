Superstore Sales Data Pipeline
==============================
This is a final project after participated Business Intelligence Engineer Bootcamp among 2-3 months at [Binar Academy](https://www.binaracademy.com/). Its fun to learn new knowledge (Technical Documentation, ETL Process & Data Warehousing) and technologies (Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery & Data Studio) related to BI Engineering job. Appreciated the organizer and instuctors, they really design a good syllabus and guide students well.

## Project Overview
<p>This project contains the process of retrieving, cleaning, and standardizing data from flat files and designing a data warehouse in Google BigQuery so we can use it to build superstore sales visualization dashboards (monthly, quarterly and yearly).</p> 

<p>There are 3 main process of this project. First, we use python to automate flat files extraction process from Google Drive and load it to data staging in Google BigQuery. Secondly, we are build data warehouse from data staging in Google BigQuery, back up data warehouse to Google Storage and schedule it monthly using BigQuery Scheduler. At the end, we will use Google Data Studio to build superstore sales visualization dashboard.</p>
